# CS50_course
This repository showcases my work from Harvard's CS50 course. It includes projects and exercises that guided me through the basics of programming in C, data structures, algorithms, and later topics like Python, SQL, and web development. Each project represents a step in my learning journey, where I focused on developing problem-solving skills.
